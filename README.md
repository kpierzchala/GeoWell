# Geothermal well calculator
## GeoWell v.1.0

Geothermal well calculator provides valuable information about wellhead temperature changes during the simulation.
The calculator was created especially for users without programming skills. That is why all necessary input data need to be fulfilled in an Excel file.
The tool is based on finite different method and is dedicated to single phase fluid flow (liquid).
Distinquished feature of the calculator is a module containing assessing thermophysical properties of brine in a broad range of temperature, pressure and salinity.
Tool will be useful for scientists, engineers and people from geothermal industry.

For more information please read the included manual.
